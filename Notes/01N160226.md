1. Started, or can say restared broCode today for python again. First vedio done. Second vedio, about variable is running.
2. Explisit type cast is where we tell with code that which type of data its gonna be. In implicte it converts on behalf of setation. Like if you dive an integer with float value, answer is gonna be float.
You can check it with print(type(Variable)). That's it.
